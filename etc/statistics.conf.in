# Sample statistics configuration file. To use @PACKAGE_NAME@'s RPKI statistics
# tools, copy this to @pkgsysconfdir@/statistics.conf and edit the
# values below as directed by the comments.
#
# Default values are commented out. To change the default, uncomment the line
# and edit the value. Configuration options that need to be filled in are
# uncommented and have placeholder values. Edit the placeholders.
#
# Options for files (e.g., TrustAnchorLocators) or directories (e.g.,
# RPKIStatisticsDir) can take either absolute paths or paths relative to this
# configuration file.

# Database to use.
# WARNING: This database may be repeatedly cleared by the statistics tools. DO
#          NOT list any database here that contains valuable information.
Database some_database # ANY DATA IN THIS DATABASE WILL BE DELETED

# User to connect to the database as.
DatabaseUser some_user

# Password of DatabaseUser above.
DatabasePassword some_password

# ODBC DSN for the Database. This should match one of the sections in your
# odbc.ini file. For example, if there's a section "[myodbc]" in /etc/odbc.ini,
# this configuration item could be set to "myodbc".

# List of TALs to use. These should be stored locally such that only trusted
# users can modify these files, i.e. they should normally be in
# @pkgsysconfdir@. Here's more information on TALs:
#
# A trust anchor certificate in the RPKI is obtained through a long term
# Trust Anchor Locator (TAL), which allows distribution via a mix of
# out-of-band and online means [RFC 6490].  In practice, relying parties
# obtain TAL files through a trusted out-of-band channel of their choice.
# For testing purposes, you can use the examples in @sampletadir@
# or Rob Austein's collection of sample trust anchors found at
# http://subvert-rpki.hactrn.net/trunk/rcynic/sample-trust-anchors .
# Additionally, to get a copy of ARIN's TAL, go to
# https://www.arin.net/public/rpki/tal/index.xhtml and follow the
# directions there.
#
# If you want to get started testing things out and don't want to worry
# about TALs yet, uncomment the section below and comment out the other
# section with placeholder values for TrustAnchorLocators. Note that unlike
# the other commented out configuration parameters, this is not the default,
# just an example.
#
#     # DO NOT TRUST THESE FOR ANYTHING EVEN SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT.
#     # They are for testing only.

# If a ROA at one point had a trust chain back to a trust anchor
# validating it, but then later lost this trust chain due to a
# certificate expiring or being revoked by a CRL, then the ROA is
# in a validation stale state.
# Specifying no means that all such ROAs are eliminated from the output,
# while yes treats all such ROAs as equivalent to valid ROAs.
#RPKIAllowStaleValidationChain no

# If a ROA or any certificate on its trust chain has never been on a
# valid manifest, then there is reason to consider the ROA suspect.
# Specifying no means that all such ROAs are eliminated from the output,
# while yes treats all such ROAs as equivalent to valid ROAs.
#RPKIAllowNoManifest yes

# If a CRL is stale, i.e. the current time is past its next update time,
# and a more recent replacement CRL has not arrived, then all the
# certificates in the scope of this CRL and their descendants are suspect.
# Specifying no eliminates all such objects, while yes allows them
# into the output (essentially ignoring this type of staleness).
#RPKIAllowStaleCRL yes

# In the same way that a CRL can be stale, so can a manifest, which makes
# all the certificates in its scope and their descendants stale.
# Specifying no eliminates all such objects, while yes allows them
# into the output (essentially ignoring this type of staleness).
#RPKIAllowStaleManifest yes

# Certificate can be added that have not yet become valid. Yes includes
# these certificates, no excludes them.
