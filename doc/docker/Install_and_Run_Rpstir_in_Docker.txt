Install and Run RPSTIR in Docker

1. Install Docker
Docker is available on multiple platforms. Please refer to  https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ for detailed installation steps.


2. Get RPSTIR Images in Docker
There are two ways to get RPSTIR images. The RPSTIR images is based on centos6.9, and it includes RPSTIR, all dependent softwares and mysql server.
The script below needs to be run as root.

Note: The root user name and password of mysql is root/Rpstir-123, and the RPSTIR user name and password is rpstir/Rpstir-123.


2.1 Compile Docker Images by Dockerfile 
By run the docker_build_centos6.9.sh in doc/docker, which compiles the Dockerfile in doc/docker/dockerbuilder/Dockerfile, a RPSTIR Images which name is rpstir/rpstir_docker_centos6.9 can be builded. The step is:
./docker_build_centos6.9.sh


2.2 Pull Docker Images from Dockerhub
By run the docker_pull_centos6.9.sh in doc/docker, which pull RPSTIR images from Dockerhub, a RPSTIR Images which name is rpstir/rpstir_docker_centos6.9 can be getted. The step is:
./docker_pull_centos6.9.sh


3 Initialize and Start Docker

3.1 Initialize Docker
The docker_init_run_centos6.9.sh initialize the volume and create the container.The volume uses /root/dockervolume in host machine as persistent storage, and it's subdirectories store different data. The step is:
./docker_init_run_centos6.9.sh


3.2 Start Docker
The  docker_start_centos6.9.sh start the RPSTIR in docker, and will attach in the docker. The step is:
./docker_start_centos6.9.sh


3.3 Stop Docker
The  docker_stop_centos6.9.sh stop the running RPSTIR in docker. The step is:
./docker_stop_centos6.9.sh


4 Run RPSTIR 
Please refer to "3. Running the RPKI Software" in  README.in .
