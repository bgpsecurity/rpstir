NAME

        rsync_aur - notifies database of files downloaded by rsync

SYNOPSIS
  
        rsync_aur -f logfile -d topDir [-t | -u | -n] -s -e -h 
            -i -w



DESCRIPTION

        The rsync_aur program reads a log prepared by the rsync program.  For
        each message in the log, it sends a message over a socket to the 
        database client to put the files obtained by rsync into the database 
        after validating them.  There are two sibling directories defined for 
        rsync, one called REPOSITORY and the other called LOGS.  Within 
        REPOSITORY are directories, one for each source used by rsync.  For 
        each such directory there is a file in LOGS that lists all the files 
        downloaded by rsync plus some other items.  The name of the log file 
        is derived from the name of the directory in REPOSITORY, e.g. directory
        "xxx" has a log file named "xxx.log".  The rsync_aur program must be 
        run from REPOSITORY.  The meanings of the parameters are:

            -f logfile specifies the path name of the log file.

            -d topDir specifies the relative path name of the directory
               being sent.

            -t specifies to use a TCP socket (see the RPKIPort configuration
               option for the port it uses), or

            -u specifies to use a UDP socket (see RPKIPort), or

            -n specifies to send no messages but print them on stdout.

            -s if present, sends a special message at the end and waits for
               a response. 

            -e if present specifies that, if the log entry has an unknown
               opcode, the contents are sent in an error message.

            -h if present, calls for display of parameter usage.

            -i if present, certain messages in the log (described below) are
               sent as informational messages, otherwise they are discarded. 

            -w if present, calls for a warning message to be sent instead of
               the normal message for any log entry that has improper syntax.

        An alternative to supplying all the parameters separately in the call 
        to rsync_aur is to put them in a single file separated by white space
        and to give the name of that file as a single parameter when calling the 
        program.  The name of the file must not begin with a hyphen.
            
        Each socket message consists of a single letter followed by a space and
        optional other material.  The message types designated by the letter are:

            B followed by the date and time.  This is the first message

            C followed by the name of the directory under REPOSITORY

            A followed by the name of a file which rsync added followed by a
              space and a number: 1 for a file mentioned in a manifest with a
              correct hash; 0 for a file not mentioned in a manifest; -1 for a
              file mentioned but with a bad hash or not found.  If the file is 
              a manifest, the numeric value is always 1; an invalid manifest is
              never sent.

            R followed by the name of a file which rsync deleted

            U followed by the name of a modified file which rsync sent
              followed by a spcae and a number indicating the status, as
              in an "A" operation

            I followed by usually irrelevant information (only if -i switch
              is set)

            X followed by the full content of a message which had an unknown
              first character (only if -e switch is set)

            W followed by the full content of a message that had improper
              syntax (only if -w switch is set)

            E followed by a date and time indicating the end of the transfer.
    
        If the -n switch is present, the socket messages are sent to stdout 
        instead.

            In addition to the socket messages, the program also prints on 
        stdout the same message preceded by "Sending ".  
        
            Any errors, such as invalid manifests (bad dates, bad signature, no 
        EE certificate, more than one certificate, bad version in certificate...), 
        are reported on stderr.
